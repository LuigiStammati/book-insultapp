1) If you don't have one, create a GitHub account at http://github.com 

2) If you don't have it, get yourself access to Openshift Online https://manage.openshift.com/

3) Open Openshift web console

4) Create a project and give it the name you want

5) Enter the search pattern postgresql , and click on the bottom hit, called Data Stores: PostgreSQL (Persistent)

6) Specify the values that you want (but remember them) for:

PostgreSQL Connection Username: let's call it <USER>
PostgreSQL Connection Password: let's call it <PASSWORD>
PostgreSQL Database Name: let's call it <DBNAME>

7) Click on Create

8) [Optional] On the next screen, take advantage of the opportunity they give you to install the "oc" tool for your OS.
You can do "oc login" and then throughout the lab execute oc commands, which are a similar to kubectl commands.

9) Click on Continue to Overview, then Click on Applications > PODs... and see the different PODs that get started, stopped, and sometimes deleted.

10) Once there is a POD running and named postgresql-<four_letters>, click on it. 

11) Click on Terminal. Execute the following on the terminal:

ps -ef
psql
\dt   # Nothing here, the DB is empty
\q    # You leave the DB

12) Go to https://github.com/virtualhops/book-insultapp and click on Fork

Congrats, now you have your own repository for book-insultapp. Its URL is:

https://github.com/<your_github_username>/book-insultapp

Copy that value, let's call it <GITHUB_REPO_URL>

Please check the main java code of the repo:

https://github.com/<your_github_username>/book-insultapp/blob/master/src/main/java/org/openshift/InsultGenerator.java

13) On Openshift , click on Applications > Deployments , then on Add to Project (it's on top of the page). Select Browse Catalog.

14) Enter wildfly search pattern... it's a java application engine. It will at some point execute your java code on <GITHUB_REPO_URL>. Just Select.

15) Give a name to the new deployment, and specify your <GITHUB_REPO_URL>

16) Click on advanced options and fill in the following environment variables that you copied in previous steps.

POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=<DBNAME>
POSTGRESQL_USER=<USER>
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>

Click on Create

17) Click on Applications > PODs... and see the different PODs that get started, stopped, and sometimes deleted. Give it some time.

18) Click on Click on Continue to Overview... there is an URL route that you can check... NOTE: it may take a few minutes to get set up by RedHat, during that time it will say "Application is not available".

19) Empty database? You need to populate it. Either on the crappy web terminal (right-click, paste) or with the superb oc exec tool, execute the following on the firefly POD:

env | grep SQL
psql -h $POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST -p $POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT -U $POSTGRESQL_USER $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE < insults.sql

20) Try the URL again... and again... but please don't be offended, it's not personal.

21) Delete the project... you will need the resources for the next lab:
